# SwarmJoinRequest

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ListenAddr** | **string** | Listen address used for inter-manager communication if the node gets promoted to manager, as well as determining the networking interface used for the VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint (VTEP).  | [optional] [default to null]
**AdvertiseAddr** | **string** | Externally reachable address advertised to other nodes. This can either be an address/port combination in the form &#x60;192.168.1.1:4567&#x60;, or an interface followed by a port number, like &#x60;eth0:4567&#x60;. If the port number is omitted, the port number from the listen address is used. If &#x60;AdvertiseAddr&#x60; is not specified, it will be automatically detected when possible.  | [optional] [default to null]
**DataPathAddr** | **string** | Address or interface to use for data path traffic (format: &#x60;&lt;ip|interface&gt;&#x60;), for example,  &#x60;192.168.1.1&#x60;, or an interface, like &#x60;eth0&#x60;. If &#x60;DataPathAddr&#x60; is unspecified, the same address as &#x60;AdvertiseAddr&#x60; is used.  The &#x60;DataPathAddr&#x60; specifies the address that global scope network drivers will publish towards other nodes in order to reach the containers running on this node. Using this parameter it is possible to separate the container data traffic from the management traffic of the cluster.  | [optional] [default to null]
**RemoteAddrs** | **[]string** | Addresses of manager nodes already participating in the swarm.  | [optional] [default to null]
**JoinToken** | **string** | Secret token for joining this swarm. | [optional] [default to null]
